## Description ##

This plug-in extends on the capabilities of [Shortcake (Shortcode UI)](https://en.wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) by adding rich text editing capabilities to textarea inputs in the Shortcake interface, when the specific textarea constructors contain the shortcake-richtext class name.

It uses the [Summernote](http://summernote.org/) Super Simple WYSIWYG Editor on Bootstrap library.

Important: at the time of writing the Wordpress plugins directory version of Shortcake (Shortcode UI) has not been updated since November 2015. This functionality relies on [PR #628](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake/pull/628) which got merged into the master branch of the plug-in in August 2016.

## Installation ##

You need the latest code in master from the Github repository of [Shortcake (Shortcode UI)](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake) already installed and activated. As soon as the newer release of the plug-in comes out (v0.6.3), this will be able to be used with the Wordpress plugins directory version from that point forward.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/shortcode-ui-richtext` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Add the meta class option to the textarea input type of an existing shortcake register_for_shortcode call
3. Add the meta class option to the textarea input type of an existing shortcake register_for_shortcode call.
4. Due to the possibility of the HTML content to contain special characters like [, ] and ", it is highly recommended to turn on the encode flag as well.
```php
'encode' => true,
'meta'  => array(
	'class' => 'shortcake-richtext',
),
```

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How does an example rich textarea input element shortcake register code looks like? ###
This is a default shortcode with a single textarea:

```php
shortcode_ui_register_for_shortcode( 'shortcode_name',
	array(
		'label'         => esc_html__( 'Shortcode Name', 'namespace' ),
		'listItemImage' => 'dashicons-text',
		'attrs'         => array(
			array(
				'label' => esc_html__( 'Text Element', 'namespace' ),
				'attr'  => 'text_element',
				'type'  => 'textarea',
			),
		),
	)
);
```

This is the same code with the richtext capability added in on the text_element:

```php
shortcode_ui_register_for_shortcode( 'shortcode_name',
	array(
		'label'         => esc_html__( 'Shortcode Name', 'namespace' ),
		'listItemImage' => 'dashicons-text',
		'attrs'         => array(
			array(
				'label' => esc_html__( 'Text Element', 'namespace' ),
				'attr'  => 'text_element',
				'type'  => 'textarea',
				'encode' => true,
				'meta'  => array(
						'class' => 'shortcake-richtext',
				),
			),
		),
	)
);
```

### This doesn't work although I added the class according to the instructions. Am I missing anything? ###
Before submitting a report on the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/xwp/wp-shortcode-ui-richtext/issues), please ensure you are running the latest Shortcake (Shortcode UI) version downloaded from their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake).

This depends on newly added functionality to the Shortcake plug-in, which have not yet been released in the Wordpress Plugins directory. Shortcake versions up to and including 0.6.2 won't work.
